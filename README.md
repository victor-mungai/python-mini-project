 🐍 Python Mini Projects

Hi! I'm Victor Mungai, and this repository contains my mini projects as I learn Python—one step at a time. My long-term goal is to become a skilled **DevOps Engineer**, and this repo is a foundation of that journey.

 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

- To build solid Python fundamentals
- To improve my scripting and automation skills for DevOps
- To stay consistent and document my progress

✅ Project Descriptions
FizzBuzz Challenge
Prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, it prints “Fizz”; for multiples of 5, it prints “Buzz”; and for numbers divisible by both, it prints “FizzBuzz”.

Even or Odd Counter
Prompts the user to input 10 numbers, counts how many are even and how many are odd, and prints the totals.

Guess the Number
Generates a random number between 1 and 20. The user keeps guessing until they get it right, and the program shows the number of attempts taken.

🧺 Data Structures Practice
Shopping List
Accepts shopping items from the user until they type "done", stores them in a list, and displays the sorted list alphabetically.

Phone Book
Builds a phone book using a dictionary from 5 user-entered name-number pairs. The user can then search for a name to retrieve its phone number.

List Reversal Without Built-in Function
Implements a custom function to reverse a list without using Python’s reversed() function or slicing.

🔪 Slicing & String Tasks
Palindrome Checker
Takes a string input and checks if it’s a palindrome—ignoring spaces and capitalization—then informs the user of the result.

Word Splitter
Asks the user to input a sentence, splits it into words, counts them, and identifies both the shortest and longest words.



 🛠️ What i'm proud of

- Used the move.sh file to automatically create folders for the python files
 🧠 What's Next

- Automate small tasks using Python
- Work with files and APIs
- Build CLI tools
- Integrate with Jenkins, Docker, and other DevOps tools
